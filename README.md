# Jeffrey W. Hollister ([@jhollist](https://twitter.com/jhollist))

My name is Jeff, and my pronouns are he/him. I live in Rhode Island with my wife and kids. 

You can find out more about me at <https://jwhollister.com>

And since I always forget how to set up git credentials for RStudio and GitHub...
- usethis::gh_token_help() - for some useful info.
- usethis::create_github_token() - don't forget to copy the token
  - Don't forget SSO Authorization if relevant
- gitcreds::gitcreds_set() - paste your token at the prompt
- usethis::git_sitrep() - just to make sure it all worked!
- Also, usethis::edit_git_config can be useful
